Databricks documentation
========================
-------------
Introduction 
-------------

Databricks is a cloud-based platform for scalable data engineering, analytics, and machine learning. It supports Delta Sharing, an open protocol for securely sharing live data across platforms without duplication. 

In the Matchbook AI integration, Delta Sharing enables clients to share input data and receive enriched results through a secure and automated pipeline. Each client is assigned a unique identifier and a dedicated catalog, allowing data to be processed and tracked independently. 

This guide walks you through how to use Databricks and Delta Sharing to securely exchange and process data with Matchbook AI. Here, you will know how to 

* Access and retrieve your Delta Sharing identifier 

* Create and share a catalog with Matchbook AI 

* Import input data (CSV/Excel) into the Matchbook platform 

* Trigger jobs for cleansing, matching, and enrichment 

* Automate workflows using tokens and REST API calls 

* Monitor and manage shared data and job results
